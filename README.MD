#Calorie Tracker Website
--
This repo contains basic code for a calorie tracker website idea I've had that allows users to enter caloric consumption every day and then be presented with some basic analysis on their entries. 

I'm currently implementing it using flask supported by a PostgreSQL database. Libraries I'm using include Flask, psycopg2, and SQLAlchemy.

Things left to do:  
 
 - Deploy app using heroku
 - use ploty or some other software to generate more dynamic charts
